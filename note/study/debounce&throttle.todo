# Debounce & Throttle

## Debounce
Waits for a certain amount of time (delay) after the last event call, and then executes the function only once.
Examples:
  - Search input box: Waits until the user finishes typing and then calls the API
  - Window resize: Executes the function only once after the user finishes resizing the window
  - Auto-save feature: Saves the data only when the user stops typing

## Throttle
Limits the number of times a function can be called within a certain time period (interval).
Examples:
  - Scroll event handling: Executes the function at a certain interval while scrolling
  - GPS location tracking: Limits the number of location updates while tracking
  - Mouse movement handling: Limits the number of drag and move events
